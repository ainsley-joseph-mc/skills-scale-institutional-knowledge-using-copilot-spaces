# OctoAcme Project Management Process Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation hub! This README serves as your entry point to understanding how OctoAcme runs projects, from initial concept through delivery and continuous improvement.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a structured yet flexible project management approach that emphasizes:

- **Customer-first mindset**: Prioritizing customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: Shipping small, testable increments to gather feedback quickly
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has designated Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead roles
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measuring impact and iterating based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Fostering an environment that encourages feedback and learning

## Project Lifecycle

Our project lifecycle consists of five key phases:

1. **Initiation**: Define problem statement, identify stakeholders, and establish high-level timeline
2. **Planning**: Break down scope, allocate resources, identify dependencies, and set milestones
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, and iterate on deliverables
4. **Release**: Deploy to production, verify functionality, and announce to stakeholders
5. **Close & Retrospective**: Capture learnings, celebrate wins, and identify improvements

## Key Roles

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk management, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design, and ensure testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, feedback, and approvals

For detailed role descriptions, see [Roles and Personas](./octoacme-roles-and-personas.md).

## Communication Cadence

- **Weekly sync** between PM and PdM
- **Twice-weekly standups** for delivery team (or as agreed)
- **Monthly stakeholder updates**
- **Ad-hoc escalations** as needed

## Key Practices & Artifacts

Our projects rely on several key artifacts and practices:

- **Project Charter / One-pager**: Defines problem, goals, and success metrics
- **Roadmap and Release Plan**: Visualizes timeline and key milestones
- **Sprint/Iteration Backlog**: Prioritized work items with acceptance criteria
- **Definition of Done**: Ensures consistent quality standards
- **Risk Register**: Tracks risks, dependencies, and mitigation plans
- **Retrospective Notes**: Captures learnings and action items for continuous improvement
